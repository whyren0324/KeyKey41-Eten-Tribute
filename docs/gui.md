# GUI

This document describes the main graphical user interface components of Win-McBopomofo on Windows, along with their design requirements and implementation principles.

## UI Components

The IME UI mainly consists of three parts:

- Candidate Window
- Tooltip Window
- Language Bar Icons

These three components are responsible for candidate presentation, auxiliary user hints, and IME mode and feature entry points.

## Runtime Ownership

The custom Candidate Window and Tooltip Window are owned by the Server process (`McBopomofoServer.exe`). The Server creates, renders, positions, and hides these popup HWNDs. The Client (`McBopomofoTIP_v2.dll`) remains responsible for TSF integration inside the foreground application process: it updates TSF composition, publishes candidate data through `ITfUIElementMgr` when available, probes caret/range geometry, and sends layout/visibility requests to the Server for custom popups.

This means the Client decides whether a custom popup is needed and where it should anchor, while the Server owns the actual custom popup window lifetime and painting.

## Shared Requirements

All IME UI components should meet the following requirements:

- They must render at the correct scale across different screen resolutions and DPI settings, without appearing blurry, too small, or too large.
- They must be able to render color emoji correctly, so the text rendering API must support color fonts and color emoji.
- Window sizes must be calculated from actual content so that text, candidate items, and hints are not clipped.
- The candidate window and tooltip window should use the same drawing API and similar rendering flow whenever practical, to reduce maintenance cost and behavioral drift.
- They must be able to appear correctly in a wide range of Windows applications, including traditional Win32 applications, modern applications, and different text input hosting environments.

## Visual Integration

Many IMEs introduce their own visual systems, color themes, and font customization surfaces. Win-McBopomofo intentionally takes a different approach: its GUI should feel integrated with Windows rather than like a separate themed application. It should use Windows system colors, theme state, and personalization settings wherever practical. Users who want to customize the input experience should do so through Windows Settings, such as system theme, accent color, text scaling, and related accessibility settings.

The IME should not provide additional color pickers, font family selection, or IME-specific appearance themes. The only intentional exception is the tooltip window's pale yellow background, which is a product-specific visual convention.

## Candidate Window

The candidate window is the primary custom UI of the IME. It displays candidates, the current selection, and any necessary supporting information.

### Requirements

- It must support configurable font size.
- Its background color and text color must follow the system theme setting, including dark mode and light mode.
- Its highlight color must be derived from the system theme.
- Its overall appearance should feel integrated with the Windows system UI. Personalization should be handled through system theme and system color settings, rather than through additional IME-specific appearance settings.
- It must not provide color, font family, or theme customization beyond Windows system personalization.

### Design Principles

- Visually, it should feel like a natural extension of system UI rather than a separate themed surface.
- The adjustable option is readability-related font size, not overall typographic styling.
- It should maintain clear contrast and legibility across different system themes and accent color combinations.

## Tooltip Window

The tooltip window is used to present short, direct hints to the user in specific application scenarios.

### Requirements

- It should use a simple pale yellow background with black text as an intentional product-specific exception to the system-color rule.
- It must not provide font family or font size customization.
- It is intended to provide user hints in specific application contexts.

### Design Principles

- The tooltip is a supporting hint surface, not the primary interaction surface, so its presentation should remain simple, stable, and easy to read.
- Although its visual design is more fixed than the candidate window, it should still share the same window management and drawing foundation whenever practical.

## Language Bar

The Language Bar icons are the IME's integration points in the Windows language bar, providing mode switching and feature entry points.

### Button Roles

The TSF language bar items intentionally separate the Windows taskbar IME mode icon from the legacy language bar buttons:

| Item | GUID constant | Kind | Surface | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| IME mode icon | `GUID_LBI_INPUTMODE` | `ImeModeMenu` | Windows taskbar IME mode icon | Left-click toggles Chinese/English mode through `GUID_COMPARTMENT_KEYBOARD_OPENCLOSE`; right-click opens the mode menu. This is the only item marked with `TF_LBI_STYLE_SHOWNINTRAY`. |
| Switch language | `GUID_LBI_SWITCH_LANG` | `SwitchLanguageToggle` | Legacy Windows Language Bar | Left-click toggles Chinese/English mode through `GUID_COMPARTMENT_KEYBOARD_OPENCLOSE`; right-click has no menu action. |
| Full/half punctuation | `GUID_LBI_FULL_HALF` | `FullHalfToggle` | Legacy Windows Language Bar | Left-click toggles full-width/half-width punctuation; right-click has no menu action. |
| Settings | `GUID_LBI_SETTINGS` | `SettingsMenu` | Legacy Windows Language Bar | Left-click and right-click open the settings-oriented language bar menu. |

Do not reuse `GUID_LBI_INPUTMODE` for full-width/half-width punctuation. Windows uses that item as the taskbar IME mode icon, so it must represent Chinese/English mode switching on left-click and mode menu access on right-click rather than punctuation width.

### Requirements

- It must provide a Chinese/English mode switch button.
- It must provide a full-width/half-width punctuation switch button.
- It must provide an advanced features menu.

### Design Principles

- The Language Bar should expose the most essential and frequently used switching actions.
- Advanced features should be grouped under a menu entry rather than scattered across multiple UI surfaces.
- This layer should prioritize system integration and behave in a way that matches Windows users' expectations of the language bar.

## Summary

The core GUI goals of this IME are:

- Stable presentation across a wide range of Windows host applications.
- Correct scaling on high-DPI and mixed-resolution displays.
- Use of a rendering API that can correctly display color emoji.
- A shared technical foundation between the candidate window and tooltip window wherever practical.
- Visual behavior that follows Windows system theme and personalization, without introducing IME-specific color, font family, or theme customization, except for the tooltip window's pale yellow convention.
